#plotly:plotly is a python visualization library that allows you to create interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs. It provides a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and more. Plotly is built on top of the JavaScript library D3.js and can be used in Python through the plotly.py library. It is commonly used for data visualization in various fields such as data science, analytics, and web development.
#It gives the interactive graphs
#we can able to zoom in and out of the graph
#streamlit->used to create web applications
